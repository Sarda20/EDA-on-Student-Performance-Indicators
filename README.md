# Student Performance Predictor â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis

**This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to student academic performance. The goal is to uncover key patterns, trends, and insights that can help predict student outcomes and understand the factors influencing their success.

The main objectives of the EDA are:

Understand the structure and content of the dataset

Identify key features that impact student performance

Explore relationships between demographic, academic, and personal variables

Detect missing values, outliers, and anomalies

Generate visualizations for better data interpretation**
